    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Ribeye steak is a rich, flavorful cut of beef known for its marbling, which gives it a juicy, tender texture. <br>
        Cut from the rib section, it has a robust, buttery flavor with a balance of fat and meat that melts during cooking, <br>
        making it one of the most popular steaks.
    </p>
    <h3>My note</h3>
    <p>Ribeye steak and New York strip steak are my favorite steaks. They are not too dry. Ribeye will give you more juicy taste.

    </p>
    <h3>Ingradients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ribeye steak (preferably thick-cut, bone-in or boneless)</li>
        <li>Salt (for seasoning)</li>
        <li>Olive oil (or any cooking oil, for searing)/li>
        <li>Butter (for basting)</li>
        <li>Garlic (optional, for flavor)</li>
        <li>Oil and butter</li>
        <li>Fresh herbs (optional, such as rosemary or thyme)</li>
    </ul> 
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Season the steak.</strong> Generously season both sides of the ribeye with salt and freshly ground black pepper. <br>
             Let it sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Sear the steak.</strong>Once the skillet is hot, place the steak in the pan. Sear for 3-4 minutes on each side, <br>
             until a golden-brown crust forms.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Add butter and herbs.</strong> Lower the heat, add butter, garlic, and herbs (rosemary or thyme) to the skillet. <br>
            Baste the steak by spooning the melted butter over it for another 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest the steak.</strong>Remove from the pan and let the steak rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing.</li>
        <li><strong>Enjoy your juicy ribeye steak.</strong></li>
