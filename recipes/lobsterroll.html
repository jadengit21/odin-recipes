    <img src="../imgs/lobsterroll.jpg" width="650" height="581" alt="A lobster roll picture">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A lobster roll is a sandwich filled with fresh lobster meat, typically served cold with a light mayo dressing or <br>
        warm with melted butter. Nestled in a toasted, buttery split-top bun, the tender, sweet lobster meat is complemented <br>
        by a soft yet crispy texture, delivering a rich, ocean-fresh flavor.
    </p>
    <h3>My note</h3>
    <p>I have tried lobster roll several times. It tastes fresh and light sweet. I am looking forward to having a better one.

    </p>
    <h3>Ingradients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Lobster meat (cooked, usually claw, knuckle, and tail meat)</li>
        <li>Split-top hot dog buns (lightly toasted and buttered. Brioche version is better.)
        </li>
        <li>Mayonnaise (cold versions)</li>
        <li>Butter (for warm versions, melted)</li>
        <li>Lemon juice (a squeeze for flavor)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper (for seasoning)</li>
        <li>Celery (optional, finely chopped for added crunch)</li>
        <li>Chives or parsley (optional, for garnish)</li>
    </ul> 
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the lobster.</strong> Boil or steam lobster until fully cooked. Then, remove the meat from the claws, <br>
             knuckles, and tail, and chop into bite-sized pieces.</li>
        <li><strong>Toast the buns. </strong>Lightly butter and toast the split-top buns in a skillet until golden and crispy.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the lobster mixture.</strong> For a cold roll, mix lobster meat with a little mayonnaise, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. <br>
             Optionally, add finely chopped celery.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the rolls.</strong>Fill the toasted buns with the lobster mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>Enjoy your tasty lobster roll.</strong></li>
