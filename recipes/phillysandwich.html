    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A Philly cheesesteak sandwich features thinly sliced, sautéed beef piled onto a soft hoagie roll, <br>
        topped with melted provolone or Cheez Whiz. Often accompanied by sautéed onions, bell peppers, <br>
        and mushrooms, the sandwich is savory, hearty, and packed with rich, indulgent flavors—a true classic from Philadelphia.

    <h3>My note</h3>
